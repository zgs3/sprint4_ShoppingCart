# Sprint 4 - Shopping list app

* Project which I've done for a Sprint 4 task while studying at BIT. 
* 
* Development progress was tracked by submiting commits using Git CLI.


## Description

* This project was made for shopping list app, but it can be used for making other lists like "To-do list".

* App is saving items and loading saved items using browser local storage.


## How to use the app?

* First, you need to create your first list: 

1. Locate the input field "new list" nearly at the center of the page.
2. Enter any list name like "Shopping list" and press "Enter" or "+" button on the left of the input field. Feel free to create more lists.
3. Your new list will appear above input field. Click on newly created list name.
4. After clicking on the name, the list will open in a new table including new input field.
5. Enter any item or a task name in the new input field "new task or item" and press "Enter" or "+" button.
6. And here you have your first list and items.

### Next options:

* You can select and mark items / tasks as "checked" by pressing on them.
* Below the item list you can press "Clear completed tasks" and "checked" items will be deleted.
* Below the item list you can press "Delete list" and the list which is selected at the moment will be deleted.
* Also you are able to track the number of how many "unchecked" items or tasks are left in the top right corner of the list item.


## Techniques used
